# Powercoders full-stack web development track, spring 2021

For an overview of the course, see the curriculum.

## How to build the slides

Slides are compiled from `*/Readme.md` files to `*/slides.html` [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) presentations using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/).

If you have `pandoc` and `make` installed on your computer, your can directly run:

```
make
```

If you don't but you have [docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed, then you can use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

```
docker-composer up
```
